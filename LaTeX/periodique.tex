We assume here that both players have a periodic strategy.Let $ \varphi_i $ and 
$ \alpha_i $ the phase and the period of the player $i$. So, we have for each $n$,
\[ t_{i,n} = \varphi_i + n.\alpha_i \]

We can assume that $\alpha_0 \leq \alpha_1 $. 
As the average gain rate doesn't depend of the initial time, we can assume that $ \varphi_0 = 0 $ too.
Let $ \Gamma\left(\alpha_0,\:\alpha_1,\:\varphi_1\right) $ be the average gain rate for the player $ 0 $.
It's easy to sea that :
\[ \Gamma\left(\alpha_0,\:\alpha_1,\:\varphi_1\right) = \Gamma\left(1,\:\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0},\:\varphi_1\right) \]

%\[ \Gamma\left(1,\:\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0},\:\varphi_1\right)
%= \lim_{N\rightarrow +\infty} \frac{1}{N}
